# Overview

Here I preform an analysis of the weather data. 

In `data_analysis_pipeline.ipynb` I do a general analysis of weather data whereas in `data_analysis_pipeline.ipynb` - where I explote the tools developped in the former notebook - I do an analysis of crop years.


# Method

The method followed to perform time series analysis (after visualization)

  1) decompose the series into 3 component: *Trend, Seasonal, Noise*

  2) interpret trend: *ascendent, descendent, stationary*

  3) interpret seasonal: *period*

  4) noise: find the distribution followed by noise (visually)


# Purpose

Check that the used weather data make sense - periodicity in records due to seasons.

Investegate trends in crop year.
